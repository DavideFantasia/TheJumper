# TheJumper
a simple platform game made in C++ without the use of classes

this project is one of the first time I approched coding, it's very slow and poor-written, but it's still a good memory

it's built from the ashes of a snake game, converted and rewritten.

from the beggining, this was more than a fun project more than a show-off
it is required to play attention while playing, being this laggy, it may cause problem to people with photosensitive epilepsy

# TheJumper
a simple platform game made in C++ without the use of classes
it is required to play attention while playing, being this laggy, it may cause problem to people with photosensitive epilepsy

this project is one of the first time I approched coding, it's very slow and poor-written, but it's still a good memory.
you can take this game as a lesson of "How to not write readable code".
It's all in one driver function, without any good documentation, unfinished feature, without backups version, mixed languages; but a lot of love

it's built from the ashes of a snake game, converted and rewritten.

this was never meant to look good, it was a learning moment to me, I were 14/15 years old when I written it.
have fun looking and lurking in those ~425 lines of hell.
